        <p>Once there was boy who wrote magnificent stories about technology and the
internets. He talked about tales of discoveries and adventures, of code and
sorcery, of... <em>well you get the point</em>.</p>
<p>Let me tell you his story.</p>
<div class="section" id="the-art-of-blogging">
<h2>the art of blogging</h2>
<p>For many months he poured all of his energy in an ancient art called
&quot;blogging&quot;.</p>
<p>He learned about the arcane languages called &quot;HTML&quot;, &quot;CSS&quot;, and
&quot;Javascript&quot; that is used to invoke the necessary spells to put up a
&quot;website&quot; that runs inside these puny looking contraptions called
&quot;servers&quot;.</p>
<p>And so he wrote one webpage after another. Days went by like a puff of
smoke. He wrote with so much glee it seemed like madness</p>
<p>One day, while he was out for a walk, he discovered a magical piece of
software called a &quot;CMS&quot;. He spent quite a while researching and learning
about it. He learned that in order to wield it one must setup a &quot;Database&quot;
to store the website scriptures among many things.</p>
<p>&quot;This could really improve my blogging techniques!&quot;, he thought.</p>
<p>So off with the old and into the new! He started using the &quot;CMS&quot; and got
absorbed in its power and extravagance.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="complexity">
<h2>complexity</h2>
<p>Many months passed by and his website grew in popularity. Traffic surged
and things appear to have taken a new direction.</p>
<p>He became focused on the black arts of getting more mailing list
subscribers, selling affiliate products, gaining more social network
followers. Even the topics he chose to write about have become focused
around these matters.</p>
<p>He also invoked one &quot;plugin&quot; after another as the CMS permits its wielder to
extend its power with such spells. All of which are for vanity's sake.</p>
<p>Eventually he spent more time configuring than writing.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="losing-purpose">
<h2>losing purpose</h2>
<p>As he continued down this new path, the boy started becoming weary.
Inspite of the lights, glamour and all things shiny, he felt empty. Lost.</p>
<p>&quot;Everything appears to be going well but it all feels wrong somehow...&quot;, he
thought.</p>
<p>For a brief moment (about 2 seconds) he remembered the days of old. With
only a simple parchment he calls a &quot;text editor&quot;, he wrote stories of his
discoveries and adventures and how he would go about it for many hours.</p>
<p>It was the good times indeed, with nothing but the innocence and the
passion of sharing.</p>
<p>&quot;I've become lost.&quot;, he mumbled.</p>
<p>And so the very next day the boy set off to a journey to find himself once
more.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="the-order-of-silly-walks">
<h2>the order of silly walks</h2>
<p>He travelled for many days. He went from one village to the next. He
trekked on great plains, majestic mountains, and myterious forests.</p>
<p>One day while he was out for a drink along a stream, he saw a group of
merry men doing some sort of outlandish dancing.</p>
<p>Curious about what's going on, he cautiously approached one of them.</p>
<p>&quot;What do you call this silly dancing, sir?&quot;, the boy asked.</p>
<p>&quot;Dancing?! Preposterous! We are channeling our energies to wield a
powerful, yet cleverly simple, software called the Pelican.&quot;, the man
replied.</p>
<p>Later he learned that the group was called the <cite>Order of Silly Walks</cite>.
They too are bloggers like him and gained a cult following of
audience. But they appeared different somehow. They looked happy, fulfilled,
simple and pure to the core.</p>

<h2>a new path</h2>
<p>&quot;I must know their secret!&quot;, he thought.</p>
<p>Mustering his strength, he asked the man once more...</p>
<p>&quot;You need not ask young man. You appear to have to lost your way and so we
shall show you the path back your self. We shall teach you the way of the
Pelican!&quot;, said the man.</p>
