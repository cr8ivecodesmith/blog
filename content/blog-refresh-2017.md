Starting over this blog has been one of this things I've been itching to do
but never got to do because `#life-happens`.

However I am currently in between moving to a new job and a new home, and
finally having the a quiet time to sit down and write this as I enjoy a cup of
coffee... yay!

Some of the things on my plate that I am planning to write about:

- hard+soft skills for my [new job][newjob] as lead developer
- learning/teaching methods
- calisthenics and health hacks
- local and abroad travels
- thoughts and philosophies about my personal and professional life
- personal projects and curious experiments

Now that I've updated the theme on my blog during my downtime this week, I'm
excited to get to writing more frequently-ish!

If you're interested with the theme I used, checkout [zenmatt][zenmatt]. It's
inspired by the look and feel of [mnmlist.com][mnmlist.com].
Contributions are welcome!
