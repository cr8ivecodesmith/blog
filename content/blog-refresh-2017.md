Starting over this blog has been one of those things I've been itching to do
but never got to because `#life-happens`.

However I am currently in between moving to a new job and a new home, and
finally having a quiet time to sit down and write as I enjoy a cup of
coffee... yay!

Some of the things I will be writing about:

- hard+soft skills for my [new job][newjob] as lead developer
- improving my learning/teaching methods
- calisthenics and health hacks
- local and abroad travels
- thoughts and philosophies about my personal and professional life
- personal projects and curious experiments

Now that I've updated the theme on my blog during my downtime this week and
I've settled in with the perfect title
-- *in between code, coffee, and peanut butter*.
I'm excited to get to writing more frequently-ish!

If you're interested with the theme I used, checkout [zenmatt][zenmatt]. It's
inspired by the look and feel of [mnmlist.com][mnmlist.com].
Contributions are welcome!
