Think of a promised place where there is no pain, hunger, sickness, and
suffering. Where life is abundant and happiness is everlasting.
It could be a utopian place, or state of mind or being.

Imagine having the ability to create this world or state ourselves and making
it accessible to everyone.

As Augmented Reality (AR) and Virtual Reality (VR) is becoming more mature,
one cannot help but imagine that this will enable a future where we can create
simulated worlds like the [Matrix][a-matrix] or Star Trek's [Holodeck][a-holod]
or enable us to create avatars of ourselves like the [Surrogates][a-surrog].

Essentially, finding a way to transcend our physical selves which operates on
a particular [heirarchy of needs][a-moslow] through technology.

This transcendance has been man's journey towards [enlightenment][a-enlight].
Technology will make this accessible to everyone and allow us to unlock our
full potential.
