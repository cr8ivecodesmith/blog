If you're like me, you probably had your on-and-off bouts using a bicycle.
Perhaps you even thought it's not meant for you. However, life changes, Manila
traffic got worst, and I wanted to break away from being sedentary. So here
I am with a renewed interest in using a bicycle to commute, go places, and have
fun adventures with my family and friends.

There are a couple of challenges with this -- not having a bike and not having
enough experience in using a bike.


finding the the right bike
==========================

The first problem, *not having a bike*, should be easy enough to solve. Just
buy a bike! But this comes with a sub-problem -- *where to store the bike*.
This is a problem when your living in a 23sqm home. The solution: a folding bike!


the Nyfti folding bike
======================

As a kid, I've always thought a folding bike is such a cool thing to have. I
saw this video a few years ago that really made me yearn for one:

    <div style="padding-bottom: 1em;">
    <div class="video-container">
    <iframe id="player" type="text/html"
        width="640"
        height="480"
        src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/txi2zIjDG3Q?&enablejsapi=1&origin="
        frameborder=0>
    </iframe>
    </div>
    </div>


The bicycle featured in this video is the original `Nyfti`_ folding bike. It is
a Filipino-made bike that has a very small folding dimension. It made me dream
of travelling places with a bicycle.


experiencing a Nyfti ride for the first time
============================================

Last May 2018, I decided to pay the Nyfti workshop a visit. I met Carl Mamawal,
co-founder and CEO, and he had me try one of the bikes for a spin. I was
instantly hooked at how easy the riding and handling of the bike was.

Later he asked me what did I plan to use the bike for. I told him I would
use it to commute to my work place in BGC, then perhaps when I'm more skilled,
I'd take it for touring.

He offered to give me and Mickey a bike tour from Makati to BGC using a couple
of his demo bikes to show us a good route in and out of BGC. How cool is that?


my first 12km riding a bike
===========================

We met again a few weeks later at his place and set off to Mickey and I's
very first long-ish bike ride.

These are the Nyfti bikes we used to get to BGC. It was my first time cycling
across EDSA or cycling for more than a kilometer really. It was scary, thrilling
and just an overall fun experience!

Carl is a pretty cool guy. He was very patient and accomodating in guiding
a couple of noobs like us. He got us through EDSA and in and out of BGC safely.


getting my very own Nyfti bike
==============================

Fast forward to June 2018, I am now a proud and happy owner of a Nyfti Raio v2!

The second problem, *where to store the bike*, is solved as it fits perfectly
into a small space too!

Since then I've already taken it out for a few rides which I will be
talking about soon.
