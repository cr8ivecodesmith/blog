I started reading the book, Everything's a Hammer by Adam Savage, recently.
While I am only half way through the first chapter only, a certain sentiment
has already hit me hard.

He sounds just like me.


Adam Savage:

- He is a curious person with many pursuits.

  - As an effect, he never runs out of things to do or make.

- A generalist with a knowledge on a broad range of topics, but a master of none.

- Considers himself a maker of physical things.

- Was encouraged and supported by his parents to explore and pursue his curious
nature.

- He never delves deep enough on a subject or skill to the point of mastery,
  only to a point of reasonable proficiency: "Above mediocore" or "Mediocore+"


Might be the reason why I've never had that much motivation to finish a lot
of my video games? I usually stop once I "get" it. Its also the same with
some of the skills and projects that I've done in the past.

Not trying to make an excuse. But its assuring to know that someone as
successful as him seems like someone like me.

The rabbit hole does not go too deep but has many branching pathways.
