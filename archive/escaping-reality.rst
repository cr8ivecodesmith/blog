Matrix, Naruto, Mr. Robot, and the oncoming VR-metaverse...I get it. They
explore ways of escaping reality.


Pain
----

We like to take away the pain. We get hurt and we want the pain to go away.

- caused by other people: abuse, neglect
- unfair status/circumstances in life
- injustice
- death of a loved one

The theme being explored in the stories above is that the only way out is to
escape this reality and create a new one.

A different world where pain no longer exists.

So muchtime (and energy) is exerted in pursuit of this. Sometimes causing
others' pain in the process. It's almost like its a necessity.


Growth comes after pain
-----------------------

Perhaps what we ought to highlight is that true growth is preceeded by pain.

- New teeth comes out
- A child is born
- Learn a new skill
- Parents sacrifice for their children
- A soldier's self sacrifice to protect someone's future

The cyclical effect here is that one's growth can only be appreciated through
pain.


Embracing reality
-----------------

Instead of escaping, its better to embrace the pain.
