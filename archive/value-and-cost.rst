Think about **cost** as an economical construct. An objective means
of measuring the amount of something for trade.

Likewise, think about **value** as a subjective and personal measurement of how
important something is to you.

Trust and time are some of those currencies that people highly value.

To regain or earn back someone's trust or to make up for lost time, be it in
your business dealings or personal relationships, is to **understand the value
that the other lost**.

This can be very subjective and may have several layers to dig through. You'll
need to see things from different perspectives. Sometimes this can be very
costly and may require sacrifices and compromises.
