        <p>If you're like me, you probably had your on-and-off bouts using a bicycle.
Perhaps you even thought it's not meant for you. However, life changes, Manila
traffic got worst, and I wanted to break away from being sedentary. So here
I am with a renewed interest in using a bicycle to commute, go places, and have
fun adventures with my family and friends.</p>
<p>There are a couple of challenges with this -- not having a bike and not having
enough experience in using a bike.</p>
<div class="section" id="finding-the-the-right-bike">
<h2>finding the the right bike</h2>
<p>The first problem, <em>not having a bike</em>, should be easy enough to solve. Just
buy a bike! But this comes with a sub-problem -- <em>where to store the bike</em>.
This is a problem when your living in a 23sqm home. The solution: a folding bike!</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="the-nyfti-folding-bike">
<h2>the Nyfti folding bike</h2>
<p>As a kid, I've always thought a folding bike is such a cool thing to have. I
saw this video a few years ago that really made me yearn for one:</p>
<div class="row section-bot">
   <div class="col-lg-2 col-md-0 col-sm-0"></div>
   <div class="col-lg-8 col-md-12 col-sm-12">
      <div class="mx-auto d-block">
         <iframe id="player" type="text/html"
         width="100%" height="480"
         src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/txi2zIjDG3Q?&enablejsapi=1&origin="
         frameborder=0></iframe>
      </div>
   </div>
</div><p>The bicycle featured in this video is the original <a class="reference external" href="http://nyftibicycles.strikingly.com/">Nyfti</a> folding bike. It is
a Filipino-made bike that has a very small folding dimension. It made me dream
of travelling places with a bicycle.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="experiencing-a-nyfti-ride-for-the-first-time">
<h2>experiencing a Nyfti ride for the first time</h2>
<p>Last May 2018, I decided to pay the Nyfti workshop a visit. I met Carl Mamawal,
co-founder and CEO, and he had me try one of the bikes for a spin. I was
instantly hooked at how easy the riding and handling of the bike was.</p>
<img alt="Talking to Carl about the Nyfti bike" class="img-fluid mx-auto d-block zenm-media-max section-bot align-center" src="/static/images/getting-into-cycling-000.jpg" />
<p>Later he asked me what did I plan to use the bike for. I told him I would
use it to commute to my work place in BGC, then perhaps when I'm more skilled,
I'd take it for touring.</p>
<p>He offered to give me and Mickey a bike tour from Makati to BGC using a couple
of his demo bikes to show us a good route in and out of BGC. How cool is that?</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="my-first-12km-riding-a-bike">
<h2>my first 12km riding a bike</h2>
<p>We met again a few weeks later at his place and set off to Mickey and I's
very first long-ish bike ride.</p>
<p>These are the Nyfti bikes we used to get to BGC. It was my first time cycling
across EDSA or cycling for more than a kilometer really. It was scary, thrilling
and just an overall fun experience!</p>
<img alt="Nyfti test drive Makati-BGC 2" class="img-fluid mx-auto d-block zenm-media-max section-bot align-center" src="/static/images/getting-into-cycling-002.jpg" />
<p>Carl is a pretty cool guy. He was very patient and accomodating in guiding
a couple of noobs like us. He got us through EDSA and in and out of BGC safely.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="getting-my-very-own-nyfti-bike">
<h2>getting my very own Nyfti bike</h2>
<p>Fast forward to June 2018, I am now a proud and happy owner of a Nyfti Raio v2!</p>
<img alt="Nyfti Raio v2 proud owner" class="img-fluid mx-auto d-block zenm-media-max section-bot align-center" src="/static/images/getting-into-cycling-003.jpg" />
<p>The second problem, <em>where to store the bike</em>, is solved as it fits perfectly
into a small space too!</p>
<img alt="Nyfti Raio v2 perfect fit" class="img-fluid mx-auto d-block zenm-media-max section-bot align-center" src="/static/images/getting-into-cycling-004.jpg" />
<p>Since then I've already taken it out for a few rides which I will be
talking about soon.</p>
