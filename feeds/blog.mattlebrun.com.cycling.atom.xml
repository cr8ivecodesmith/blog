Perhaps you even thought it's not meant for you. However, life changes, Manila
traffic got worst, and I wanted to break away from being sedentary. So here
I am with a renewed interest in using a bicycle to commute, go places, and have
fun adventures with my family and friends.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are a couple of challenges with this -- not having a bike and not having
enough experience in using a bike.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="finding-the-the-right-bike"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;finding the the right bike&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first problem, &lt;em&gt;not having a bike&lt;/em&gt;, should be easy enough to solve. Just
buy a bike! But this comes with a sub-problem -- &lt;em&gt;where to store the bike&lt;/em&gt;.
This is a problem when your living in a 23sqm home. The solution: a folding bike!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="the-nyfti-folding-bike"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;the Nyfti folding bike&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a kid, I've always thought a folding bike is such a cool thing to have. I
saw this video a few years ago that really made me yearn for one:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div style="padding-bottom: 1em;"&gt;
&lt;div class="video-container"&gt;
&lt;iframe id="player" type="text/html"
    width="640"
    height="480"
    src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/txi2zIjDG3Q?&amp;enablejsapi=1&amp;origin="
    frameborder=0&gt;
&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;The bicycle featured in this video is the original &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://nyftibicycles.strikingly.com/"&gt;Nyfti&lt;/a&gt; folding bike. It is
a Filipino-made bike that has a very small folding dimension. It made me dream
of travelling places with a bicycle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="experiencing-a-nyfti-ride-for-the-first-time"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;experiencing a Nyfti ride for the first time&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last May 2018, I decided to pay the Nyfti workshop a visit. I met Carl Mamawal,
co-founder and CEO, and he had me try one of the bikes for a spin. I was
instantly hooked at how easy the riding and handling of the bike was.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img alt="Talking to Carl about the Nyfti bike" class="align-center" src="/static/images/getting-into-cycling-000.jpg" style="width: 640px; height: 480px;" /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Later he asked me what did I plan to use the bike for. I told him I would
use it to commute to my work place in BGC, then perhaps when I'm more skilled,
I'd take it for touring.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He offered to give me and Mickey a bike tour from Makati to BGC using a couple
of his demo bikes to show us a good route in and out of BGC. How cool is that?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="my-first-12km-riding-a-bike"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;my first 12km riding a bike&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We met again a few weeks later at his place and set off to Mickey and I's
very first long-ish bike ride.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img alt="Nyfti test drive Makati-BGC 1" class="align-center" src="/static/images/getting-into-cycling-001.jpg" style="width: 640px; height: 480px;" /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These are the Nyfti bikes we used to get to BGC. It was my first time cycling
across EDSA or cycling for more than a kilometer really. It was scary, thrilling
and just an overall fun experience!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img alt="Nyfti test drive Makati-BGC 2" class="align-center" src="/static/images/getting-into-cycling-002.jpg" style="width: 640px; height: 480px;" /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Carl is a pretty cool guy. He was very patient and accomodating in guiding
a couple of noobs like us. He got us through EDSA and in and out of BGC safely.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="getting-my-very-own-nyfti-bike"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;getting my very own Nyfti bike&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fast forward to June 2018, I am now a proud and happy owner of a Nyfti Raio v2!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img alt="Nyfti Raio v2 proud owner" class="align-center" src="/static/images/getting-into-cycling-003.jpg" style="width: 640px; height: 480px;" /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The second problem, &lt;em&gt;where to store the bike&lt;/em&gt;, is solved as it fits perfectly
into a small space too!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img alt="Nyfti Raio v2 perfect fit" class="align-center" src="/static/images/getting-into-cycling-004.jpg" style="width: 640px;" /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since then I've already taken it out for a few rides which I will be
talking about soon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
