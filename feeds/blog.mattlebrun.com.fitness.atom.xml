&lt;p&gt;One of my key goals for this year is to get in to the habit of keeping myself 
healthy. I believe its in our best interest as software engineers to have a 
balanced lifestlye to ensure that we are always working to the best of our 
abilities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since April of last year I've started feeling my way towards adding regular 
exercises as part of my weekly activities. I make sure that I do something to 
get my blood pumping at least once a week. While I've not been emperically 
tracking the effects of these efforts, It just feels good to get some 
adrenaline rush every now and then.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On a side note, my body fat percentage did became normal which was a first!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyway, I decided to take things up a notch for this month in the efforts of 
making this habit stick.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'll be following a 
&lt;a href="http://www.lulu.com/shop/daniel-segars-and-kelli-segars/low-impact-4-week-fat-loss-program-for-beginners/ebook/product-21250586.html"&gt;4-week program&lt;/a&gt; 
set up by the awesome folks at &lt;a href="http://www.fitnessblender.com/"&gt;Fitness Blender&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;s&gt;I'll be doing a weekly update of my progress here and see how it goes.&lt;/s&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;update&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whilst I've been lazy about documenting my 4-week experimentation, I can tell you that I've had
phenomenal results following the program.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since then, I've developed a habit of regular exercise and is now part of my weekly routine. I've
also tried out other exercise practices lately such as HIIT and the 7-minute workout to great effect
as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm now starting a new fitness program which I'll be writing about soon.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="health"></category><category term="fitness"></category></entry></feed>
