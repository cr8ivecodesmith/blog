&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://ericholscher.com/blog/2017/dec/2/breaking-cliques-at-events/#difficulty-meeting-new-people"&gt;difficulty in meeting new people&lt;/a&gt;. This striked me as a very important point
as I personally relate to the idea that as an introvert, I find it difficult
talking to people without anything to talk about. Especially talking about
things that would be mutually interesting to both parties. Right there and
then, I knew &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://twitter.com/cr8ivecodesmith/status/937531469194395648"&gt;I just had to try&lt;/a&gt; this out for this year's PyConPH.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The approach we did was to have people gather around topic facilitators during
lunch. The topic facilitators were people from the volunteers and speakers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We made the announcement just before dismissing everyone for lunch that there
will be people holding up papers with a topic around the place. If the topic
interests them, we encouraged them to go there and talk about it with other
people interested in the same topic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The response was very positive! People were chatting and making new friends!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another thing we did was put bookmarks of the same design in their swagbags and
encourage them to find people with a different design to trade with.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Do you have other tips on making people interact more during conferences? I'd
love to hear your thoughts and stories. Talk to me on &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://twitter.com/cr8ivecodesmith/status/969460040288559105"&gt;twitter&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
