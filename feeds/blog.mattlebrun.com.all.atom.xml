Perhaps you even thought it's not meant for you. However, life changes, Manila
traffic got worst, and I wanted to break away from being sedentary. So here
I am with a renewed interest in using a bicycle to commute, go places, and have
fun adventures with my family and friends.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are a couple of challenges with this -- not having a bike and not having
enough experience in using a bike.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="finding-the-the-right-bike"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;finding the the right bike&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first problem, &lt;em&gt;not having a bike&lt;/em&gt;, should be easy enough to solve. Just
buy a bike! But this comes with a sub-problem -- &lt;em&gt;where to store the bike&lt;/em&gt;.
This is a problem when your living in a 23sqm home. The solution: a folding bike!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="the-nyfti-folding-bike"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;the Nyfti folding bike&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a kid, I've always thought a folding bike is such a cool thing to have. I
saw this video a few years ago that really made me yearn for one:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="row section-bot"&gt;
   &lt;div class="col-lg-2 col-md-0 col-sm-0"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
   &lt;div class="col-lg-8 col-md-12 col-sm-12"&gt;
      &lt;div class="mx-auto d-block"&gt;
         &lt;iframe id="player" type="text/html"
         width="100%" height="480"
         src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/txi2zIjDG3Q?&amp;enablejsapi=1&amp;origin="
         frameborder=0&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
      &lt;/div&gt;
   &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;The bicycle featured in this video is the original &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://nyftibicycles.strikingly.com/"&gt;Nyfti&lt;/a&gt; folding bike. It is
a Filipino-made bike that has a very small folding dimension. It made me dream
of travelling places with a bicycle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="experiencing-a-nyfti-ride-for-the-first-time"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;experiencing a Nyfti ride for the first time&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last May 2018, I decided to pay the Nyfti workshop a visit. I met Carl Mamawal,
co-founder and CEO, and he had me try one of the bikes for a spin. I was
instantly hooked at how easy the riding and handling of the bike was.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img alt="Talking to Carl about the Nyfti bike" class="img-fluid mx-auto d-block zenm-media-max section-bot align-center" src="/static/images/getting-into-cycling-000.jpg" /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Later he asked me what did I plan to use the bike for. I told him I would
use it to commute to my work place in BGC, then perhaps when I'm more skilled,
I'd take it for touring.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He offered to give me and Mickey a bike tour from Makati to BGC using a couple
of his demo bikes to show us a good route in and out of BGC. How cool is that?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="my-first-12km-riding-a-bike"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;my first 12km riding a bike&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We met again a few weeks later at his place and set off to Mickey and I's
very first long-ish bike ride.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These are the Nyfti bikes we used to get to BGC. It was my first time cycling
across EDSA or cycling for more than a kilometer really. It was scary, thrilling
and just an overall fun experience!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img alt="Nyfti test drive Makati-BGC 2" class="img-fluid mx-auto d-block zenm-media-max section-bot align-center" src="/static/images/getting-into-cycling-002.jpg" /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Carl is a pretty cool guy. He was very patient and accomodating in guiding
a couple of noobs like us. He got us through EDSA and in and out of BGC safely.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="getting-my-very-own-nyfti-bike"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;getting my very own Nyfti bike&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fast forward to June 2018, I am now a proud and happy owner of a Nyfti Raio v2!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img alt="Nyfti Raio v2 proud owner" class="img-fluid mx-auto d-block zenm-media-max section-bot align-center" src="/static/images/getting-into-cycling-003.jpg" /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The second problem, &lt;em&gt;where to store the bike&lt;/em&gt;, is solved as it fits perfectly
into a small space too!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img alt="Nyfti Raio v2 perfect fit" class="img-fluid mx-auto d-block zenm-media-max section-bot align-center" src="/static/images/getting-into-cycling-004.jpg" /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since then I've already taken it out for a few rides which I will be
talking about soon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://ericholscher.com/blog/2017/dec/2/breaking-cliques-at-events/#difficulty-meeting-new-people"&gt;difficulty in meeting new people&lt;/a&gt;. This striked me as a very important point
as I personally relate to the idea that as an introvert, I find it difficult
talking to people without anything to talk about. Especially talking about
things that would be mutually interesting to both parties. Right there and
then, I knew &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://twitter.com/cr8ivecodesmith/status/937531469194395648"&gt;I just had to try&lt;/a&gt; this out for this year's PyConPH.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The approach we did was to have people gather around topic facilitators during
lunch. The topic facilitators were people from the volunteers and speakers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We made the announcement just before dismissing everyone for lunch that there
will be people holding up papers with a topic around the place. If the topic
interests them, we encouraged them to go there and talk about it with other
people interested in the same topic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The response was very positive! People were chatting and making new friends!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="row section-bot"&gt;
   &lt;div class="col-lg-2 col-md-0 col-sm-0"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

         frameborder=0&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
      &lt;/div&gt;
   &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another thing we did was put bookmarks of the same design in their swagbags and
encourage them to find people with a different design to trade with.&lt;/p&gt;

It could be a utopian place, or state of mind or being.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Imagine having the ability to create this world or state ourselves and making
it accessible to everyone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As Augmented Reality (AR) and Virtual Reality (VR) is becoming more mature,
one cannot help but imagine that this will enable a future where we can create
simulated worlds like the &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Matrix"&gt;Matrix&lt;/a&gt; or Star Trek's &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Holodeck"&gt;Holodeck&lt;/a&gt;
or enable us to create avatars of ourselves like the &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surrogates"&gt;Surrogates&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Essentially, finding a way to transcend our physical selves which operates on
a particular &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maslow%27s_hierarchy_of_needs"&gt;heirarchy of needs&lt;/a&gt; through technology.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This transcendance has been man's journey towards &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enlightenment_(spiritual)"&gt;enlightenment&lt;/a&gt;.

&lt;p&gt;However I am currently in between moving to a new job and a new home, and
finally having a quiet time to sit down and write as I enjoy a cup of
coffee... yay!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some of the things I will be writing about:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;hard+soft skills for my &lt;a href="https://totalrewardssoftware.com/"&gt;new job&lt;/a&gt; as lead developer&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;improving my learning/teaching methods&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;calisthenics and health hacks&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;local and abroad travels&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;thoughts and philosophies about my personal and professional life&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;personal projects and curious experiments&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now that I've updated the theme on my blog during my downtime this week and
I've settled in with the perfect title
-- &lt;em&gt;in between code, coffee, and peanut butter&lt;/em&gt;.
I'm excited to get to writing more frequently-ish!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you're interested with the theme I used, checkout &lt;a href="https://github.com/cr8ivecodesmith/zenmatt"&gt;zenmatt&lt;/a&gt;. It's

- me (when deciding to write this post)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of my key goals for this year is to get in to the habit of keeping myself 
healthy. I believe its in our best interest as software engineers to have a 
balanced lifestlye to ensure that we are always working to the best of our 
abilities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since April of last year I've started feeling my way towards adding regular 
exercises as part of my weekly activities. I make sure that I do something to 
get my blood pumping at least once a week. While I've not been emperically 
tracking the effects of these efforts, It just feels good to get some 
adrenaline rush every now and then.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On a side note, my body fat percentage did became normal which was a first!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyway, I decided to take things up a notch for this month in the efforts of 
making this habit stick.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'll be following a 
&lt;a href="http://www.lulu.com/shop/daniel-segars-and-kelli-segars/low-impact-4-week-fat-loss-program-for-beginners/ebook/product-21250586.html"&gt;4-week program&lt;/a&gt; 
set up by the awesome folks at &lt;a href="http://www.fitnessblender.com/"&gt;Fitness Blender&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;s&gt;I'll be doing a weekly update of my progress here and see how it goes.&lt;/s&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;update&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whilst I've been lazy about documenting my 4-week experimentation, I can tell you that I've had
phenomenal results following the program.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since then, I've developed a habit of regular exercise and is now part of my weekly routine. I've
also tried out other exercise practices lately such as HIIT and the 7-minute workout to great effect
as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm now starting a new fitness program which I'll be writing about soon.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="fitness"></category></entry><entry><title>so long 2013, thanks for all the fish!</title><link href="https://blog.mattlebrun.com/2014/01/so-long-2013-thanks-for-all-the-fish.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2014-01-01T00:00:00+08:00</published><updated>2014-01-01T00:00:00+08:00</updated><author><name>Matt Lebrun</name></author><id>tag:blog.mattlebrun.com,2014-01-01:/2014/01/so-long-2013-thanks-for-all-the-fish.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;Another year has been shaved off of my remaining years of existence and its

high time to reflect on all of my experiences.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;tl;dr&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2013 was a year filled with unexpected, yet pleasant turn of events.
A lot of milestones have been reached earlier than expected.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now for the long version...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;save22&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last April I joined the engineering team of Save22. My growth as an engineer 
has really took off to a whole new level. I never had a chance to work with an 
engineering team as passionate and awesome. It's contagious.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Its interesting to note that the company's registered name is BOB FTW, where 
BOB stands for &lt;em&gt;Band of Brothers&lt;/em&gt;. We do live up to the name and its spirit. 
I'm really thankful for all the experiences and friends I've gained there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This year, I hope to bring in more contribution to the success of our company.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;family diner&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We've moved into a more cost-effective home/biz place. Its a 2-storey house 
where we've turned the 1st floor into the diner.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The family food business has been doing well early 2013 however things have 
been quite challenging towards the end.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, our hopes remain high for this year. My plan is to find management 
seminars usually organized by Hapinoy and GoNegosyo or any other community 
where we can get ideas on how to take the family biz to the next level.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;python.ph, inc&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Python Users Group Philippines has come a long way. 2013 is a milestone. 
Together with a group of core volunteers, we've incorporated our small group as 
a non-profit organization duly recognized by the Philippine government and the 
&lt;a href="http://www.python.org/psf/"&gt;Python Software Foundation&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our mission: To promote the Python programming language and to facilitate the 
growth of our local community of professionals and enthusiasts while hoping to 
make a small dent of improvement to the Philippine IT industry.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Co-founding and running a non-profit organization takes a lot of dedication and 
drive. I'm really lucky to be around this group of awesome folks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This organization is very dear to me. Not only because its my first time to 
undertake something like this, but also because its been one of my long-term 
dreams to build a foundation similar to this. In a way, I'd like to believe 
that this is a granted wish from the heavens.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;secret projects&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2013 served as the breeding ground for the idea behind our secret project to 
solidify. This year the goal is to set the initial stages in motion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;padlamat&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Owning a home is waaay down our bucket list however when an opportunity was 
presented to Ela and I, we just had to take it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ela and I got ourselves a pre-selling studio condo in the Ayala Group's 
&lt;a href="http://www.avidaland.com/Avida-towers-asten.php"&gt;Avida Asten&lt;/a&gt; project in 
Makati. We would've went for a 1-bedroom unit had our budgets permitted. This 
takes a significant cut from our wedding savings fund but in any case, we are 
very happy with this humble abode.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We're now looking forward to the 2017 turnover of &lt;em&gt;padlamat&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;parting thoughts and on to 2014&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For me, 2013 has really been the most eventful year yet. Most of the things 
that have happened are but a starting point so I'm expecting challenges to come 
this year. If anything, I'm actually looking forward to it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2014 here we go!&lt;/p&gt;</content></entry><entry><title>new year, new home for my domains</title><link href="https://blog.mattlebrun.com/2013/12/new-year-new-home-for-my-domains.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2013-12-21T12:40:00+08:00</published><updated>2013-12-21T12:40:00+08:00</updated><author><name>Matt Lebrun</name></author><id>tag:blog.mattlebrun.com,2013-12-21:/2013/12/new-year-new-home-for-my-domains.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;Its almost Christmas and the domains I've registered last year are a few days

short of expiration. Its time to make a choice!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;GoDaddy - a brief background&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last year I got myself several nice domains for a very cheap price at GoDaddy. 
I was pretty much new with buying stuff online and I'm a cheapskate and GoDaddy 
sort of handed me that indulgence. You simply search over the internets you'll 
find GoDaddy coupons all over the place.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, as I learn more about the domain registration and differences between 
each registrar I've kinda regretted that decision.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;NameSilo - a new beginning&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was yesterday when I started to take seriously GoDaddy's email notifications 
about my domains that are due for expiration soon. As I checked, the renewal 
cost where really high. What I previously got for dirt cheap (~US$3), will 
now cost me about US$14. And I have 4 of them expiring soon!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was already considering moving away from GoDaddy after all the controversies 
spinning around the company anyway so this only sealed that deal for me. Time 
to hit the internets to search for alternatives.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;NameCheap was up my alley at this point, in fact I have 1 domain with them. 
However as I looked further, I stumbled upon NameSilo.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now NameSilo just clicked with me instantly. Cheap, no upsells, no hidden 
charges, free WHOIS protection, and most importantly registration costs are the 
same as renewals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So I reloaded my prepaid credit card and went on about the domain transfer 
process. It was relatively straightforward and about 20mins later my domains 
are now happily hanging out on NameSilo.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In case you're looking into transferring your domains or thinking of getting a 
new one, I highly recommend in giving them a try.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;promoted links&lt;/h2&gt;

about it as much as I can before proceeding with my journey.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I found the most comfortable spot behind a large boulder nearby for I know 
not what danger could befall me in this unfriendly looking part of this 
land.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I've also noticed that I am actually carrying with me packs of rations and 
a pencil and journal. I've decided to note down important and interesting 
stuff from the history book.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;political history&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This land called Britannia underwent an Age of Darkness. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first was when the land was terrorized by an evil wizard named Mondain 
who was later felled by an adventurer. However it was followed by 
restlessness for the people of Britannia can't seem to get over the terror.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Modain's terror soon lived anew through his apprentice Minax. Soon a new 
age of darkness befell the land. Her powers soon grew greater than her 
former master that it spread through time itself. Later heroes of legend 
emerged and killed her in her castle. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For twenty years peace has roamed the land of Britannia. Then disturbing 
omens appeared and was later followed by an emergeance of a fiery island. 
This signified the third era of darkness. This story was accounted by 
Iolo, the bard. Lord British of Sosaria called through time and space for 
heroes. Four diverse individuals came to answer the call and soon the 
greatest battle of their time ensued. After ardous struggle, the heroes 
won and felled Exodus. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From the rubbles of Britannia, Lord British united the land under one rule 
and raised the quality of life in the land. Britannia is now in a new age 
of peace and progress.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;geography&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Looking at the map that I have, I continued to read through the chapter 
that talked about the different places indicated. I was able to make out 
which place are being mentioned in the book as it appears in the map.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lord British Castle - Situated in the center of the continent, overlooking 
Britanny Bay.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Town of Britain - Located near Lord British Castle. Bards thrive here. 
Perhaps I can find Iolo here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Serpent's Spine - A great mountain range in the north of Lord British 
Castle. There's an out-of-the-way pass here during summer for faster 
travel. Beware of Cyclops and Ettins! &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Deep Forest - Northwest of Serpent's Spine. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;City of Yew - Located deep within the Deep Forest. Druids live here. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Empath Abbey - The Spiritual Center of Britannia located near the City of 
Yew. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;High Steppes - Located in the east of the Deep Forest famous for their 
horses. This place seems to have a lot of Rogues and evil Wizards. There's 
also lake here known for mysterious disturbances. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bloody Plains - Located just beyond the High Steppes. Named after the fact 
that it was a site for great battles during the dark ages. Rumor has it 
that in some phases of the moon ghosts appear and relive that battle once 
again. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lost Hope Bay - Located north of the Bloody Plains. Tinkers live here. 
This town is also know for the Wayfarer's Inn.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Northeastern Tip of Brittania - Beware of poisonous marshes, large swarm 
of insects, and other vile beasts. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Trinsic - Located in the southern edge of the continent. Here, I can find 
Paladins. The Tap has a bartender who is a great source of gossip. I'll 
remember to tip him well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cape of Heroes - Found in the claws of the southern edge of the continent. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Order of Silver Serpent HQ - Found in an island south of Cape of Heroes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Valarian Isles - Slightly to the west of Cape of Heroes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jhelom - An town within the Valarian Isles know for the best Inn and 
bravest Fighters.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Skara Brae - Home of the Rangers. Located in an island in the west of the 
continent. There's a Mystic Healer here who can cure all sorts of disease 
and you only pay what you can afford.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Verity Isle - Northeastern part of Britannia.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lycaeum - Found within Verity Isle. It is the center of higher learning 
and astronomy in Britannia.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Moonglow - A city know for mages. Found in the south of Verity Isle. Here 
I can find herbs and regent to mix to prepare magical spells? Interesting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are still several uncharted places here in Britannia but the ones 
that I have to be specially wary of is the &lt;em&gt;Fens of the Dead&lt;/em&gt;. It appears 
like all manner of evil roam this place.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There's also a place far off named &lt;em&gt;Magincia&lt;/em&gt; which the gods have 
destroyed because of the insufferable pride of the people who lived there. 
Magincia was once a rich and beautiful town but its now in complete ruins.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;wait a minute...&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Magincia sounds familiar.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I glanced over the rock from which I was sitting and looked at the ruins 
a few meters away. There's a sign in one of the pillars the read 
&lt;em&gt;"Magincia"&lt;/em&gt;. The books says this town is filled with ailing spirits of 
the inhabitants. No wonder this place feels unfriendly. I better stay away 
from that place for now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The book also mentioned to avoid the dungeons scattered all over the 
continent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;fellowship&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There seems to be eight major professions in the whole of Britannia. All 
of them are based from one of the major towns mentioned in the geography 
except for one - the &lt;em&gt;Shepherd&lt;/em&gt;. Also all the other seven professions 
appear to have their own specialty and coolness factor except for the 
Shepherd, whom the book describes as:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is uncertain whether Shepherds are skilled in any form of warfare or 
in the mystic arts. However, they are highly valued travelling 
companions for their humility and their knowledge of the ways of the 
land.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Great! Looks like I got the worst profession in this land after all. No 
magic, no fighting skills... This is going to be tough. But I'm also not 
afraid of anything. I'll get by somehow.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It also looks like I'll need to find companions along the way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;mercantile&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A variety of shops are found in each town. There are Inns, Pubs, Armories, 
Weaponries, etc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Inside Lord British Castle, lives Seer Hawkwind who can give advice about 
the path I have to take.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There's also a persisting rumor that a Thieves Guild still exists 
somewhere in one of the uncharted islands.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Herb shop sells ingredients needed to perform spells. Some rare 
ingredients are not sold all the time if not at all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;transportation&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ah this is most important for a journeyman such as myself. There are 
several modes of transportation in Britannia: Feet, Horse, Ship. But the 
most interesting method though is via Moon Gates. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The active gate is indicated by the phase of the moon Trammel, while the 
destination gate is indicated by the phase of the moon Felucca.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So that explains the moon illustrations all over the map as well as the 
two moons I see in the sky.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also, of all the terrain types in Britannia the most dangerous one are the 
marshes because of its poisonous vapors. Come to think of it, there are 
marshes all over this place.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Lycaeum appears to have been working on a lighter than air device but 
the blueprints have been stolen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;weapons and armour of the realm&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of all the available weaponry and armours I can only wear cloth and either 
use a staff or a slingshot. I guess a bow is worth a try as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are also rumours of magical weapons and armor but they'll become 
available when the weilder is ready. How?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;magical arts&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The secret is a proper mix of the available ingredients. I think the other 
book can guide me here better. But I must find a companion who can wield 
magic first.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The most powerful ingredients: Nightshade and Mandrake root are not for 
sold anywhere. I wonder where I can find them?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;bestiary&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It appears that there's a number of creatures in this realm but they're 
either neutral or evil types. I guess its better to avoid the evil ones at 
all cost and avoid killing the neutral ones.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;the skills of combat&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I can summarize the notes indicated in the book:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Always be prepared before engaging the enemy.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Avoid killing neutral enemies.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Take advantage of terrain tactics.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It is not cowardly to flee when necessary.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;modern civilization and our universe&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This chapter explained a lot the reason behind this whole incident.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Looks like in this new age of peace where the focus of human development 
is no longer about expanding territory and fighting a world terror, a 
question needs answering. What is the next step in human evolution? What 
should be our focus to keep the peace we are enjoying and demonstrate what 
we have learned from the wrongs of the past?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To answer this question we must turn inward. Look within ourselves.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The author went on with an interesting premise that one must journey and 
learn the ways of the world and discover the essence of good. A journey to 
become an &lt;em&gt;Avatar&lt;/em&gt; of all the virtues.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It looks like the book mentions that this is the journey that I have to 
take and that this is my destiny.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This all seems unbelievable to me. Why me? I'm just a regular peaceful guy 
going on about my life. Though I've always been someone who tries to seek 
out my purpose outside of the mundane, this is just too much!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I really have to see Lord British and talk to him. Maybe he can send me 
back to my time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h5&gt;Notes&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whew that was a handful! But I think writing it all was quite worth it. It 
made me realize certain aspects of the game that I didn't quite understand 
when I was playing it back in 2001. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I finally understood how those damn Moon Gates work!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;UPDATE 2018-12-07&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a merger from a gaming blog I thought of making before.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="game-journal"></category><category term="ultima-iv"></category></entry><entry><title>ultima iv - the quest begins</title><link href="https://blog.mattlebrun.com/2013/08/ultima-iv-game-journal-001.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2013-08-06T22:35:00+08:00</published><updated>2013-08-06T22:35:00+08:00</updated><author><name>Matt Lebrun</name></author><id>tag:blog.mattlebrun.com,2013-08-06:/2013/08/ultima-iv-game-journal-001.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;It's been a very challenging week for me and I just wanted to escape from

it all. Life hasn't really been treating me well. The new job didn't quite 
turned out what I wanted to do after all, I had a fight with my 
girlfriend, my parents are having all sorts of domestic issues. Oh man!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Good thing its the weekend and I can finally get some peace and quiet by 
the willow tree in the nearby hills. I really like hanging out here. It 
really relaxes my mind and I can be calm and still.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;a strange happening&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was just about to fall a sleep when a some kind of portal appeared a few 
meters in front of me. There was a bright light and in an instant the 
portal disappeared. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I then saw something glimmer and then there was a loud &lt;em&gt;"thud"&lt;/em&gt;. Walking 
towards the sound, I saw a cross with a circle on top of it. People call 
this an &lt;em&gt;"Ankh"&lt;/em&gt;. I heard the Egyptians thinks of it as a symbol of life. 
Right beside it are a couple of books wrapped in cloth which resembles a 
map with strange writings on it. One of the books is a history book and 
the other one is a strange looking book about magic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Somehow, I am compelled to read the history book. So I browsed over it, 
but shortly decided to put it away for now. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;beyond the hills&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Suddenly I heard a mix of merry music and laughter behind a nearby hill. 
I was attracted to it. As I was approaching the source of the sound, I was 
welcomed with a sight of a carnival. I'm pretty sure there's no carnival 
here before. Its all very strange indeed. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I continued walking towards the entrance. When the guard saw my Ankh he 
ushered me right in. I was then attracted to a strange music coming from a 
wagon. I walked straight for it, not minding the rest of the carnival. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Inside, I was met by a Gypsy who's also wearing an Ankh. She mentioned 
something about they've been waiting for me. She then told me that its 
time to reveal my destiny. I feel very strange and creeped out right now 
but I'm somehow curious to know what is she talking about. So I decided to 
play along.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;going spiral&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She brought out some cards and an abacus-like object minus the beads and 
begun asking me situational questions depending on the card the she 
picked. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I answered them honestly and once the final question was answered, the 
Gypsy said that my path is set. Suddenly, I started feeling very dizzy. 
Everything around me suddenly turned spiral. Before I lost consciousness, 
I heard the Gypsy told me to seek out the King to find out what my mission 
is. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;the journey begins&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I regained my consciousness, I found myself lying on the ground with 
staff on my hand. The Ankh is around my neck and the map and books were 
right beside me. I'm also wearing a brownish robe and tunic, just like the 
shepherds I see in pictures. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The land around me is very strange and seems dangerous. Suddenly I 
remembered the events that transpired before I got here. I'm supposed to 
find the King of this land. I remembered his name is Lord British. But how 
do I get there and where am I exactly?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As if my problems aren't big enough, now I'm stuck in some strange land 
with no clue on what's happening. I'm both terrified and strangely excited 
at the same time. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Terrified of what perils are in stored for me here yet excited by the 
smell of adventure and new discoveries. I've always been the curious, 
adventurous type after all!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I guess I better finish reading the history book to get some clues.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h6&gt;Notes&lt;/h6&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In case you missed it, I actually got a Shepherd class character. I 
haven't played this class before and I'm quite excited to play him out. Oh 
and I named him &lt;code&gt;Eli&lt;/code&gt;. It just seems like I've been quite fond of using 
that name for my characters lately. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also, notice that I've decided to write the story in first-person POV for 
better immersion. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think Ultima IV is one of those games where you really have to play out 
the role to get the most out of the game. Its not just about 
hack-and-slashing your way through the game or making the best character 
build or unlocking the next achievement or highscore. Its a genuine 
experience where the game doesn't hold your hand and leaves you in a 
massive world waiting for you to experience and discover its secrets and 
grandeur. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lastly, be forewarned: There will be typos and grammatical errors!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is a merger from a gaming blog I thought of making before.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="game-journal"></category><category term="ultima-iv"></category></entry><entry><title>a gaming blog</title><link href="https://blog.mattlebrun.com/2013/08/a-gaming-blog.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2013-08-06T18:25:00+08:00</published><updated>2013-08-06T18:25:00+08:00</updated><author><name>Matt Lebrun</name></author><id>tag:blog.mattlebrun.com,2013-08-06:/2013/08/a-gaming-blog.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"The games of old are nothing like the games of this age."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That was my prevailing thought after a long chat with Ron and Ray …&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"The games of old are nothing like the games of this age."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That was my prevailing thought after a long chat with Ron and Ray about 
how different are the games of this generation compared to the games of 
the 80's and the 90's. We reminisced about how nostalgic and elaborate 
are the games of that time. They just have a longer lasting effect and 
develops a deep connection to the gamer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Incidentally, I was starting out with getting back at the games that I 
used to play at that time and I thought why not write about the 
adventures of the characters that I play since I'm mostly playing RPGs. 
I can also write about the kinds of games that I play and even write a 
review.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So why am I doing this?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mostly for the heck of it and it'll be a good exercise for my creative 
and imaginative side. It might even contribute to one of my long-term 
goals of creating my own graphic novel / game.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;UPDATE 2018-12-07&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a merger from a gaming blog I thought of making before.&lt;/p&gt;</content></entry><entry><title>the setup</title><link href="https://blog.mattlebrun.com/2013/06/the-setup.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2013-06-11T23:00:00+08:00</published><updated>2013-06-11T23:00:00+08:00</updated><author><name>Matt Lebrun</name></author><id>tag:blog.mattlebrun.com,2013-06-11:/2013/06/the-setup.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;I was browsing the social networks today and chanced upon

&lt;a href="http://usesthis.com/"&gt;The Setup&lt;/a&gt; which is a website that features 
interviews of people &lt;em&gt;(mostly geeks)&lt;/em&gt; where they get to talk about what 
they do and then elaborate more on what tools (hardware and software) they 
use to get shit done. I thought, "Hey that's pretty cool.", so I read on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As I browsed through one interview to the next I noticed that most 
(perhaps in the 90th percentile) are using Apple computers. Which got me to 
ponder whether this is just another Apple fan site. Thank goodness the 
author cleared this out in the &lt;a href="http://usesthis.com/about/"&gt;about&lt;/a&gt; page. I 
was short of dismissing the site as one and hitting the close button. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The interview with &lt;a href="http://eric.s.raymond.usesthis.com/"&gt;ESR&lt;/a&gt; was one that 
got me thinking and write this post. Albeit, it was the trigger after a 
spur of collective thoughts that was running in my head as I read on the 
interviews of hackers and programmers that I admire. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So in the spirit of the &lt;a href="http://usesthis.com/"&gt;The Setup's&lt;/a&gt; ethos, here's 
how my setup...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;who are you, and what do you do?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm Matt Lebrun, and I fancy myself as a hybrid programmer/designer. It's a 
work in progress and I strive to reach that ideal everyday. I speak several 
&lt;em&gt;(programming)&lt;/em&gt; languages but I love &lt;a href="http://www.python.org/"&gt;Python&lt;/a&gt; above 
all. In fact, I'm so crazy about it that I just had to spend a significant 
amount of free time volunteering to our local &lt;a href="http://python.ph"&gt;Python community&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think I should put this in a separate about page. But since I'm lazy at 
moment, this will do. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;what hardware do you use?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Have you heard of a programmer who does not own a computer? Yep I'm one of 
them. At least I used to be until a couple of months ago. For a long time, 
I contented myself with company issued computers until a life event forced 
me to buy one. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I got myself a decent &lt;a href="http://www.villman.com/Product-Detail/Acer_V5-431-10072G50Ma"&gt;Acer V5 431&lt;/a&gt;. 
It sports an IvyBridge Celeron 1007U dual-core ULV processor with internal 
Intel HD 4000 graphics. I also bumped up the pre-installed RAM to 8GB to 
make sure my VMs and numerous browser tabs are well fed. It also sports an 
Ultrabook-ish look that's nice to look at. It also had other nice features 
that I don't want to elaborate more on. Most importantly, it came with a 
price that didn't break the bank. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was happily working on it for a couple of months until the awesome folks 
at &lt;a href="http://www.save22.com"&gt;Save22&lt;/a&gt; got me a laptop of my choosing. I got 
myself a very sexy &lt;a href="http://h10025.www1.hp.com/ewfrf/wc/document?cc=us&amp;amp;lc=en&amp;amp;dlc=en&amp;amp;docname=c03508920#N351"&gt;HP Envy 4&lt;/a&gt;. 
I use this as my primary machine now and have lent my Acer machine to my 
sister indefinitely. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the mobile end, I use the 1st generation &lt;a href="http://www.gsmarena.com/samsung_p1000_galaxy_tab-3370.php"&gt;Galaxy Tab&lt;/a&gt;, 
both as a phone and tablet. I do all sorts of on-the-go stuff with it like 
taking pictures and videos, gaming, journaling, sketching, reading, social 
networking. I even code in Python on it!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;and what software?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I consider Vim my wife and SublimeText2 my mistress. As I play around with 
sublime, the more hooked I am. Is that bad?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I used NetBeans and Eclipse once when I was teaching myself to develop 
Android apps. Then &lt;a href="http://phonegap.com/"&gt;PhoneGap&lt;/a&gt; is mature enough, and 
there's even &lt;a href="http://kivy.org/"&gt;Kivy&lt;/a&gt;... &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I primarily used Chrome/Chromium as my browser of choice, but the latest 
incarnation of Firefox rekindled my love for it. So its my primary choice 
now on both my PC and tablet. I just had to say that tab groups and firebug 
should be default for any web development. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gnome Terminator is my terminal of choice. Split, tab, and theme your 
terminal to your hearts content. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I use VirtualBox heavily and run 1-3 virtual development servers at a time. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;GIMP and Inkscape are my design tools of choice. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Shutter for selective screen capture. Very important for work and noting 
things down. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;LibreOffice and Google Docs for spreadsheets and presentations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;UbuntuOne and Insync keeps my important files in the safety of the cloud. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thunderbird organizes my Gmail, Google calendar, and Google Tasks. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Skype and Empathy for chatting and office communication. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Google contacts keeps my contacts available on both mobile and PC. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;KeepassX keeps my passwords, and I got it synced on both PC and mobile. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/cr8ivecodesmith"&gt;tweet&lt;/a&gt; more nowadays. Its just a 
more sensible social network, IMHO. My Facebook interaction is limited to 
the &lt;a href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/pinoypug/"&gt;Python Users Group&lt;/a&gt; and 
posting some family photo updates. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Linux, specifically Ubuntu as my OS of choice both as my daily driver and 
on my VM dev servers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My Galaxy Tab is powered by CM10.1 and it works super fine. JB 4.2.2 and 
kernel 3.x breathed new life to this old but trusty warrior. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;what would be your dream setup?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Right now I'm very happy with my PC. Though I'm still waiting for the day 
where ~1.2kgs, ~0.7mm thick, 500GB SSD, 16GB RAM, ~3GHZ Quad-core CPU, ~2GB 
Dedicated Graphics, ~8hrs Battery, and Fully Linux compatible Ultrabooks 
would emerge. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I could also use a bluetooth stereo headset with mic that I can use on both 
my PC and tablet. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'd also wish that Ubuntu could be a bit more up to date with the latest 
kernel and do a rolling release just like Arch. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If I had the budget, I'd get something like a Galaxy Note 2 or Nexus 4. &lt;/p&gt;</content></entry><entry><title>the way of the pelican and the order of silly walks</title><link href="https://blog.mattlebrun.com/2013/05/the-way-of-the-pelican-and-the-order-of-silly-walks.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2013-05-25T18:00:00+08:00</published><updated>2013-05-25T18:00:00+08:00</updated><author><name>Matt Lebrun</name></author><id>tag:blog.mattlebrun.com,2013-05-25:/2013/05/the-way-of-the-pelican-and-the-order-of-silly-walks.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;Once there was boy who wrote magnificent stories about technology and the

internets. He talked about tales of discoveries and adventures, of code and
sorcery, of... &lt;em&gt;well you get the point&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let me tell you his story.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="the-art-of-blogging"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;the art of blogging&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For many months he poured all of his energy in an ancient art called
&amp;quot;blogging&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He learned about the arcane languages called &amp;quot;HTML&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;CSS&amp;quot;, and
&amp;quot;Javascript&amp;quot; that is used to invoke the necessary spells to put up a
&amp;quot;website&amp;quot; that runs inside these puny looking contraptions called
&amp;quot;servers&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And so he wrote one webpage after another. Days went by like a puff of
smoke. He wrote with so much glee it seemed like madness&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One day, while he was out for a walk, he discovered a magical piece of
software called a &amp;quot;CMS&amp;quot;. He spent quite a while researching and learning
about it. He learned that in order to wield it one must setup a &amp;quot;Database&amp;quot;
to store the website scriptures among many things.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;This could really improve my blogging techniques!&amp;quot;, he thought.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So off with the old and into the new! He started using the &amp;quot;CMS&amp;quot; and got
absorbed in its power and extravagance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="complexity"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;complexity&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many months passed by and his website grew in popularity. Traffic surged
and things appear to have taken a new direction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He became focused on the black arts of getting more mailing list
subscribers, selling affiliate products, gaining more social network
followers. Even the topics he chose to write about have become focused
around these matters.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He also invoked one &amp;quot;plugin&amp;quot; after another as the CMS permits its wielder to
extend its power with such spells. All of which are for vanity's sake.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Eventually he spent more time configuring than writing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="losing-purpose"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;losing purpose&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As he continued down this new path, the boy started becoming weary.
Inspite of the lights, glamour and all things shiny, he felt empty. Lost.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Everything appears to be going well but it all feels wrong somehow...&amp;quot;, he
thought.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For a brief moment (about 2 seconds) he remembered the days of old. With
only a simple parchment he calls a &amp;quot;text editor&amp;quot;, he wrote stories of his
discoveries and adventures and how he would go about it for many hours.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was the good times indeed, with nothing but the innocence and the
passion of sharing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;I've become lost.&amp;quot;, he mumbled.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And so the very next day the boy set off to a journey to find himself once
more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="the-order-of-silly-walks"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;the order of silly walks&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He travelled for many days. He went from one village to the next. He
trekked on great plains, majestic mountains, and myterious forests.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One day while he was out for a drink along a stream, he saw a group of
merry men doing some sort of outlandish dancing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Curious about what's going on, he cautiously approached one of them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;What do you call this silly dancing, sir?&amp;quot;, the boy asked.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Dancing?! Preposterous! We are channeling our energies to wield a
powerful, yet cleverly simple, software called the Pelican.&amp;quot;, the man
replied.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Later he learned that the group was called the &lt;cite&gt;Order of Silly Walks&lt;/cite&gt;.
They too are bloggers like him and gained a cult following of
audience. But they appeared different somehow. They looked happy, fulfilled,
simple and pure to the core.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="video-container"&gt;
&lt;iframe id="player" type="text/html"
    width="640"
    height="480"
    src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/IqhlQfXUk7w?enablejsapi=1&amp;origin="
    frameborder=0&gt;
&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="a-new-path"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;a new path&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;I must know their secret!&amp;quot;, he thought.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mustering his strength, he asked the man once more...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;You need not ask young man. You appear to have to lost your way and so we
shall show you the path back your self. We shall teach you the way of the
Pelican!&amp;quot;, said the man.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="the-way-of-the-pelican"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;the way of the pelican&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;In this training you shall learn to create good old static websites and
host it on Github!&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;First things first, I shall assume that you have a &lt;cite&gt;Github account&lt;/cite&gt;,
&lt;cite&gt;git&lt;/cite&gt;, &lt;cite&gt;python&lt;/cite&gt;, a &lt;cite&gt;terminal&lt;/cite&gt;, and your running &lt;cite&gt;Ubuntu&lt;/cite&gt;. Otherwise, move on
and learn them some place else then come back to me.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Otherwise, let's begin your training.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="create-an-empty-git-repository"&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;create an empty git repository&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Go to your Github account and create a new empty repo for your blog and name
it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;[username].github.io
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Using your &lt;cite&gt;username&lt;/cite&gt; is important here so that github will know that
you're trying to create a Github page.&amp;quot;, the man warned.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="clone-the-empty-repo-locally"&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;clone the empty repo locally&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Clone it to your local directory&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;$ git clone git@github.com:&lt;span class="o"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;username&lt;span class="o"&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;/&lt;span class="o"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;username&lt;span class="o"&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;.github.io.git my_blog
$ &lt;span class="nb"&gt;cd&lt;/span&gt; my_blog
my_blog $
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Install pelican with markdown and github import.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;my_blog $ pip install pelican markdown ghp-import
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="invoke-the-pelican-quickstart"&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;invoke the pelican quickstart&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Run this powerful spell to configure pelican;&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;my_blog $ pelican-quickstart
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;You will be asked many questions. Answer them as your heart desires.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Here is an example with important answers highlighted.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

thought to be just a day of fulfilling &lt;em&gt;"boyfriend duties"&lt;/em&gt;, turned out 
quite amazing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I made a realization. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In case you didn't know; dream boarding is when you put visual 
representation of your goals, desires, ambitions, dreams or what have you 
in a piece of card board &lt;em&gt;(best on an illustration board).&lt;/em&gt; The idea is 
that, these images becomes a mantra or a cue. Something that you can focus 
on. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since the workshop activities were timebound and the board we used is small 
(1/8 illustration board), we were forced to prioritize what to put on the 
board. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This got me thinking. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What are the most important goals do I have in the next couple of years or 
the next few months even? Then I realized that what I really need is to 
improve myself further. And how do I do that? Form better habits. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Maybe much of what we wanted to achieve in life may just be a byproduct of 
having good habits. &lt;/p&gt;</content></entry><entry><title>why you don't need to know everything right away</title><link href="https://blog.mattlebrun.com/2012/09/why-you-dont-need-to-know-everything-right-away.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2012-09-18T15:30:00+08:00</published><updated>2012-09-18T15:30:00+08:00</updated><author><name>Matt Lebrun</name></author><id>tag:blog.mattlebrun.com,2012-09-18:/2012/09/why-you-dont-need-to-know-everything-right-away.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;Learning and researching about a new technology or problem area is a very

exciting activity for programmers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Curiosity, for a programmer, is like an insatiable impulse. An unquenchable 
thirst. You take your time as you browse through one information to 
another. Consuming content after content. This can span from hours to days 
or longer. Your desire to "know more" drives you like a mad man. But when 
you're doing this during the course of a client project this can be a 
problem. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Enter &lt;a href="http://www.searchoptmedia.com/5-reasons-to-try-agile-in-your-next-software-project"&gt;Agile's&lt;/a&gt; 
key principle of simplicity. It gives emphasis on the simplest solution the 
would meet the requirements that best reflects your current knowledge on 
the technology and problem area.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Applying that in this context: 
&lt;strong&gt;You don't need to know everything right away.&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Trust that the deeper you go into the project, your knowledge and 
experience increases as well. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Your clients simply can't afford a prolonged or delayed release and neither 
will you have that sense of accomplishment from actually shipping 
something. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So how do you deal with your insatiable curiosity? &lt;/p&gt;</content></entry><entry><title>hello world! v2.0: reflections on leaving the 9-5 life</title><link href="https://blog.mattlebrun.com/2012/09/hello-world-v20-reflections-on-leaving-the-9-5-life.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2012-09-17T21:00:00+08:00</published><updated>2012-09-17T21:00:00+08:00</updated><author><name>Matt Lebrun</name></author><id>tag:blog.mattlebrun.com,2012-09-17:/2012/09/hello-world-v20-reflections-on-leaving-the-9-5-life.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;My recent move to finally join &lt;em&gt;(full-time)&lt;/em&gt; the tech start-up scene made me

reflect once again on this topic. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I feel like I've just stepped into the "unknown abyss" that we call the 
entrepreneurial road where a steady monthly paycheck is out of the 
question. This is quite a big leap for someone who &lt;em&gt;-- like a lot of people --&lt;/em&gt; 
have mouths to feed, debts to pay, and a family to support.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But &lt;em&gt;-- again, like a lot of people --&lt;/em&gt; I have plans for the future, 
passions to pursue, a purpose to fullfil, and I'm not getting any younger. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So I made the jump nonetheless. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's easy actually. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Just close your eyes, hold your breathe, and brace yourself for the roller 
coaster ride! &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not so fast friend! &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I didn't just went for it. If I did I would've faltered off the bat. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was preparing my heart for years. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When my heart was ready, I've talked to the people I cared about for 
support. Then, when I finally got their &lt;em&gt;(hesitant)&lt;/em&gt; blessing that's the 
time I made the jump. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You see, there's a reason why even a faint sense of responsibility is 
required for this: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;People who care about you are affected the most in every decision or path 
you take. If you care about them too, you won't feel there's any point in 
your undertakings if you don't have them to share your ups and downs. It'll 
be one lonely roller coaster ride indeed. &lt;/p&gt;</content></entry><entry><title>don't waste time, it's more scarce than you think!</title><link href="https://blog.mattlebrun.com/2012/07/dont-waste-time.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2012-07-26T18:30:00+08:00</published><updated>2012-07-26T18:30:00+08:00</updated><author><name>Matt Lebrun</name></author><id>tag:blog.mattlebrun.com,2012-07-26:/2012/07/dont-waste-time.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When you say "yes" to others, make sure you are not saying "no" to 
yourself.
- Paulo Coelho&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today I've been reminded of my struggle for having ownership with my work. 
A puzzle that I've finally solved after reaching a crossroad in my career. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I've realized that when you're just doing your job or joined a company for 
the money, you're not only short-changing yourself, you're also doing it to 
the organization. If you're like me, who always makes sure you got your end 
covered so as not to drag people down, you'll probably feel bad about doing 
this intentionally or not.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Recalling my previous work experiences; Yes I was challenged, excited, 
learned and shared new things, met new people, and I grew my skills set. 
But I never felt I owned the things I've done nor the projects I've 
launched. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At some point it just felt mechanical &lt;em&gt;-- input given, output delivered.&lt;/em&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No extra-mile. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No flowery, feel good, &lt;em&gt;if-I-blew-this-I'll-feel-like-shit-the-next-day&lt;/em&gt; 
effect. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I always ask the question, "To what end am I doing this?". &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Usual &lt;em&gt;(and wrong)&lt;/em&gt; answer: For the money. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Perhaps I never really identified with the organizations I've joined in the 
past. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Perhaps I didn't get the chance to work on things that aligned with my 
strong points. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But whatever the reason is, once you've realized these things it's time to 
stay true to yourself and others. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Change your attitude or leave the job if you have to &lt;em&gt;(or both)&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Just be sure you're not just doing it for the money &lt;em&gt;-- or you just 
momentarily have to as part of a grander purpose.&lt;/em&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Do it for love and passion instead. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A dear friend always reminds me that the money always comes after. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Again:&lt;/strong&gt; Don't waste time, it's more scarce than you think!&lt;/p&gt;</content></entry></feed>
