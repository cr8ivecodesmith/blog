This method involves setting aspirational objectives, tracking progress with leading indicators, and engaging in regular reviews, directed with experimentations and clarity in our personal and professional lives.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I now appreciate how OKRs improved the visibility of how our actions aligns with our values in our annual couple planning process.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why it clicked for us:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Every year Mickey and I reflect upon the things we've accomplished in all key areas of our lives. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While we do feel like every year we are growing and moving towards the direction we set for ourselves, I appreciate how OKRs puts these front and center.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;üßòüèΩObjectives: Clear &lt;strong&gt;end-states&lt;/strong&gt; we're excited to achieve.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;üìàKey Results: Leading &lt;strong&gt;indicators&lt;/strong&gt; guides our journey.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;‚öñÔ∏èMeasure: A 0-1 scale relative to the indicators.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;üîéReview: Regular reflections instead of just yearly.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Diving deeper:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Objectives are &lt;strong&gt;ambitious and aspirational&lt;/strong&gt; end-states directed by our values and vision.&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What do we want to become?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Where do we want to be?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Key Results are &lt;strong&gt;not goals or action items&lt;/strong&gt; like "Do X amount of events". They are measurable leading indicators like "As measured by X membership signups".&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How do we know we are getting there?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Measurement is &lt;strong&gt;not about ticking boxes&lt;/strong&gt; in your action items. Its relative to the outcomes of your Key Results.&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&amp;lt; 0.6: We need to correct course.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;0.7-0.9: We are successful! We are on the right track.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;1: We achieved a truly incredible aspiration.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Regular review is about identifying which levers to move; &lt;strong&gt;what actions to take to move forward&lt;/strong&gt;. Develop an attitude of continuous experimentation and learning.&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What do I need to do or learn to move the needle?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How do I break this down into smaller, manageable chunks?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What resources do I need?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Is this still even relevant?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Taking it further:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now that it clicked, we want to apply this to PythonPH and our other endeavors too.&lt;/p&gt;

The event also brought back the feelings we had in our 2012 PyCon experience, only now, through the unique lens as a community organizer.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Mickey and I had the privilege to attend and deliver a talk for &lt;a href="https://tw.pycon.org/2023/"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;PyCon TW last September 3&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This was our second international PyCon we've attended in person and our first time speaking in person internationally. We were very nervous but &lt;em&gt;thankfully we felt like the talk went better than we anticipated&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The talk title is &lt;a href="https://tw.pycon.org/2023/en-us/conference/talk/283"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;"One Does Not Simply Create a Lasting Tech Community"&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. We dived into the ten-year journey of PythonPH, our strategies for organizing, and our approach to leadership development. We also enjoyed answering the questions from the audience post-talk, allowing us to reflect on our journey and challenges even more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Outside of our session, I've connected with fellow attendees, leading me to reflect more about my past. Having been in the thick of balancing career, community work, and personal life, these conversations served as both reminders and lessons.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The venue, Academia Sinica, was very impressive. Despite the unpredictable weather that led to the unfortunate cancellation of some talks, &lt;em&gt;the organizers showcased resilience&lt;/em&gt;. Their meticulous planning ensured attendees and speakers like myself experienced the conference seamlessly. A particular feature that caught my attention was the innovative system for audiences to pose questions and offer feedback post-talks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Beyond the talks, &lt;em&gt;the PyCon-magic is very much alive&lt;/em&gt; as well. I made new friends, like with Junya-san, my roommate. I've made good connections with some of the event sponsors and speakers, and also made note of potential speakers for PyCon PH 2024. I also had the chance to connect with the PyCon JP organizers present.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another highlight for me was meeting the PyCon TW organizers. Their commitment, energy, and unique touch to this conference were commendable. There's much we, at PythonPH, can learn and adopt from them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;PyCon TW brought back the raw energy and passion I felt at my first PyCon back in 2012&lt;/em&gt; - a whirlwhind of inspiration, the joy of learning, and the essence of sharing. As I've become a community organizer, my perspective has evolved, allowing me to view these gatherings through a unique lens. This event has also reinforced a realization: PyCons extend beyond new technologies and methodologies. They're also about making meaningful connections, nurturing communities, and personal growth.&lt;/p&gt;
