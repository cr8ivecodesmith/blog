    <p>Learning and researching about a new technology or problem area is a very 
exciting activity for programmers. </p>
<p>Curiosity, for a programmer, is like an insatiable impulse. An unquenchable 
thirst. You take your time as you browse through one information to 
another. Consuming content after content. This can span from hours to days 
or longer. Your desire to "know more" drives you like a mad man. But when 
you're doing this during the course of a client project this can be a 
problem. </p>
<p>Enter <a href="http://www.searchoptmedia.com/5-reasons-to-try-agile-in-your-next-software-project">Agile's</a> 
key principle of simplicity. It gives emphasis on the simplest solution the 
would meet the requirements that best reflects your current knowledge on 
the technology and problem area.</p>
<p>Applying that in this context: 
<strong>You don't need to know everything right away.</strong> </p>
<p>Trust that the deeper you go into the project, your knowledge and 
experience increases as well. </p>
<p>Your clients simply can't afford a prolonged or delayed release and neither 
will you have that sense of accomplishment from actually shipping 
something. </p>
<p>So how do you deal with your insatiable curiosity? </p>
